# liver_disease_prediction

It is now extremely challenging for researchers in the healthcare industry to predict diseases from the extensive databases. 
We use classification algorithms from machine learning to resolve this issue. Predicting liver disease is the primary objective 
of this project. We have implemented machine learning algorithms. The comparison of these classifier algorithms is entirely based 
on performance, classification accuracy and execution time. As a result, the objective of our project is to compare and contrast 
the overall performance of various machine learning algorithms in order to lessen the exorbitant cost of liver disease prediction
